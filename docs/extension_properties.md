### Introduction

Imagine you're working with an online electronics store application where customers can purchase laptops based on their membership level. You constantly need to calculate different discount amounts and check membership privileges throughout your codebase. Wouldn't it be convenient if you could simply write `user.isPremium` or `product.discountedPriceFor(user)` instead of writing complex conditional logic each time? But User and Product are final classes in your system's core library, so you can't add these properties by inheritance. This is where extension properties come to the rescue â€“ they let you add new properties to existing classes without modifying their source code.

Extension properties are a cornerstone of Kotlin's philosophy of making existing code more expressive and concise. They allow developers to enhance classes that they don't own or can't modify, including final classes and those from external libraries. This feature embodies Kotlin's pragmatic approach to language design, acknowledging that developers often work with existing codebases and APIs that can't be changed directly. Extension properties make code more readable and maintainable by enabling the addition of domain-specific functionality to standard types, reducing boilerplate, and expressing concepts in a more natural way. They're particularly powerful when combined with other Kotlin features like null safety and scope functions.

Here's what we'll cover today:

- What extension properties are and how they differ from regular properties
- The syntax for defining and using extension properties
- How to define extension properties with backing fields
- Creating nullable and non-nullable extension properties
- Extension properties for generic types
- Visibility and scope of extension properties
- Companion object extension properties
- Practical use cases through our string date example
- Best practices for designing clean, focused extension properties
- Common pitfalls to watch out for when working with extension properties

### What are extension properties?

**Extension properties** in Kotlin are features that allow you to add new properties to existing classes without inheriting from them or modifying their source code. Like extension functions, extension properties appear to be regular properties of the class they extend, but they're actually defined outside the class. They enable you to enhance classes with additional state-like accessors, even when you don't have access to the original class definition or when the class is marked as final. Extension properties are resolved statically at compile-time, meaning they don't actually modify the class they extend or involve runtime reflection.

Extension properties are part of Kotlin's broader extension mechanism, which was inspired by similar features in languages like C# (extension methods) and Swift (extensions). However, Kotlin took the concept further by allowing not just methods but also properties to be extended. This feature was introduced in the early versions of Kotlin and has been a distinguishing characteristic of the language since its inception. Extension properties reflect Kotlin's emphasis on expressiveness and pragmatic design, acknowledging that developers often need to work with existing libraries and frameworks while expressing domain-specific concepts clearly. They're part of Kotlin's solution to the expression problem, which concerns how to add both new operations and new types to a system without modifying existing code.

### Extension properties syntax

#### 1. Basic extension property syntax (`val/var ClassName.propertyName: Type`)

Creating an extension property starts with `val` (for read-only properties) or `var` (for mutable properties), followed by the receiver type, a dot, the property name, and its type:

```kotlin
val String.lastChar: Char
    get() = this[length - 1]
```

Here, `String` is the receiver type (the class we're extending), `lastChar` is the property name, and `Char` is the property type. The `this` keyword refers to the receiver object (the String instance).

#### 2. Extension property getters

Unlike regular properties, extension properties don't have backing fields, so they must have explicit getters:

```kotlin
val String.wordCount: Int
    get() = trim().split(Regex("\\s+")).size
```

The getter defines how the property value is computed when accessed. In this example, we're calculating the number of words in a string.

#### 3. Extension property setters (for `var` properties)

Mutable extension properties (`var`) require both a getter and a setter:

```kotlin
var StringBuilder.lastChar: Char
    get() = this[length - 1]
    set(value) {
        this.setCharAt(length - 1, value)
    }
```

The setter defines what happens when a value is assigned to the property. The parameter `value` represents the value being assigned.

#### 4. Nullable extension properties

You can create extension properties for nullable types:

```kotlin
val String?.isNullOrBlank: Boolean
    get() = this == null || this.isBlank()
```

The `?` after `String` indicates that the receiver can be null. In the getter, `this` might be null, so we need to handle that case.

#### 5. Generic type extension properties

Extension properties can also be defined for generic types:

```kotlin
val <T> List<T>.secondOrNull: T?
    get() = if (size >= 2) this[1] else null
```

Here, we're defining a property that returns the second element of a list if it exists, or null otherwise.

#### 6. Companion object extension properties

You can define extension properties for companion objects, which act like static properties in other languages:

```kotlin
val MyClass.Companion.someProperty: String
    get() = "This is a companion object extension property"
```

With this definition, you can access `MyClass.someProperty` as if it were a static property.

### Why do we need extension properties?

Extension properties solve several important problems in programming:

- **Enhancing existing classes:**
    - They allow you to add new properties to classes that you don't own or can't modify, such as those from the standard library or third-party libraries. This is particularly useful for making APIs more suited to your specific use case.
- **Domain-specific language enhancement:**
    - You can make your code more expressive and domain-specific by adding properties that represent concepts specific to your application domain. For instance, you might add a `user.isAdult` property instead of writing `user.age >= 18` throughout your code.
- **Avoiding utility classes:**
    - Instead of creating utility classes with static methods like `StringUtils.getWordCount(str)`, you can write more object-oriented code with extension properties: `str.wordCount`.
- **Improved readability:**
    - Extension properties can make code more natural to read and write. For example, `dateString.year` is more intuitive than `dateString.split("-")[0]`.
- **Encapsulation of complex logic:**
    - They provide a way to encapsulate complex property access logic behind a simple interface. The complexity is defined once in the getter, and clients can use a simple property access syntax.
- **Compatibility with existing code:**
    - Extension properties allow you to adapt existing code to new interfaces or patterns without modifying the original code, facilitating incremental adoption of new ideas.

### Practical examples

#### 1. Creating basic extension properties for Product and User classes

Let's start by creating a scenario for an online electronics store where customers can purchase laptops and receive discounts based on their membership status.

First, I'll define the basic classes we'll be working with: a User class and a Product class.

```kotlin
data class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val membershipLevel: String, val signUpDate: String)

data class Product(val id: Int, val name: String, val basePrice: Double, val category: String)
```

Now I'll create some basic extension properties for the User class to make membership information more accessible.

I'll start with a property that checks if the user is a premium member.

```kotlin
val User.isPremium: Boolean
    get() = this.membershipLevel == "Premium"
```

Extension properties don't have backing fields, so we must define a custom getter that calculates the value. Here I'm simply checking if the membership level equals 'Premium'.

Now I'll add a property to check if the user is a standard member.

```kotlin
val User.isStandard: Boolean
    get() = this.membershipLevel == "Standard"
```

And another to check if they're a basic member.

```kotlin
val User.isBasic: Boolean
    get() = this.membershipLevel == "Basic"
```

I'll also add an extension property that calculates how long a user has been a member, in years.

```kotlin
import java.time.LocalDate
import java.time.Period
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter

val User.membershipYears: Int
    get() {
        val formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd")
        val signUpDate = LocalDate.parse(this.signUpDate, formatter)
        val currentDate = LocalDate.now()
        return Period.between(signUpDate, currentDate).years
    }
```

This property calculates the difference in years between the user's sign-up date and the current date.

#### 2. Adding discount calculation properties to products

Now let's create extension properties for the Product class that calculate different discount amounts based on the user's membership level.

Let's start with a property that calculates a basic discount available to all members.

```kotlin
val Product.basicDiscount: Double
    get() = this.basePrice * 0.05
```

This property returns 5% of the base price as the basic discount.

Now I'll add a property that calculates the standard membership discount.

```kotlin
val Product.standardDiscount: Double
    get() = this.basePrice * 0.1
```

This property returns 10% of the base price as the standard discount.

And a property for the premium discount.

```kotlin
val Product.premiumDiscount: Double
    get() = this.basePrice * 0.15
```

This property returns 15% of the base price as the premium discount.

Let's also create an extension property that calculates the discounted price based on the user's membership level.

```kotlin
fun Product.discountedPriceFor(user: User): Double {
    return when {
        user.isPremium -> this.basePrice - this.premiumDiscount
        user.isStandard -> this.basePrice - this.standardDiscount
        user.isBasic -> this.basePrice - this.basicDiscount
        else -> this.basePrice
    }
}
```

This isn't an extension property but an extension function that uses our extension properties. It calculates the discounted price based on the user's membership level.

#### 3. Adding more complex extension properties with validation

Let's enhance our extension properties with more complex logic and validation.

First, I'll create a property that checks if a product is eligible for special promotions.

```kotlin
val Product.isEligibleForPromotion: Boolean
    get() {
        // Products below $500 or not in the Laptop category aren't eligible
        if (this.basePrice < 500 || this.category != "Laptop") {
            return false
        }
        
        // Laptops priced at $500 or more are eligible for promotions
        return true
    }
```

This property checks if a product meets certain criteria for special promotions.

Now let's create an extension property that calculates an additional loyalty discount based on how many years the user has been a member.

```kotlin
fun Product.loyaltyDiscountFor(user: User): Double {
    // Calculate additional discount: 1% per year of membership, up to 5%
    val loyaltyPercentage = minOf(user.membershipYears * 0.01, 0.05)
    return this.basePrice * loyaltyPercentage
}
```

This extension function calculates an additional loyalty discount based on the user's membership duration, capped at 5%.

Let's create an extension property that calculates the final price including all applicable discounts.

```kotlin
fun Product.finalPriceFor(user: User): Double {
    val membershipDiscount = when {
        user.isPremium -> this.premiumDiscount
        user.isStandard -> this.standardDiscount
        user.isBasic -> this.basicDiscount
        else -> 0.0
    }
    
    val loyaltyDiscount = this.loyaltyDiscountFor(user)
    
    // Calculate final price by subtracting all discounts
    val finalPrice = this.basePrice - membershipDiscount - loyaltyDiscount
    
    // Ensure price doesn't go below 80% of base price (maximum 20% discount)
    val minimumPrice = this.basePrice * 0.8
    
    return maxOf(finalPrice, minimumPrice)
}
```

This extension function calculates the final price after applying membership and loyalty discounts, while ensuring the final price doesn't go below 80% of the base price.

#### 4. Creating mutable extension properties

Now let's create some mutable extension properties for a shopping cart class.

First, I'll define a simple shopping cart class.

```kotlin
class ShoppingCart {
    val items = mutableListOf<Product>()
    val customer: User? = null
}
```

Now I'll add a mutable extension property for the total price in the cart.

```kotlin
var ShoppingCart.totalPrice: Double
    get() = this.items.sumOf { it.basePrice }
    set(value) {
        // This is a bit artificial, but it demonstrates a setter
        // We'll adjust the cart contents to match the new total value
        if (items.isEmpty()) return
        
        val currentTotal = this.totalPrice
        if (currentTotal == 0.0) return
        
        val ratio = value / currentTotal
        // Create a new list with adjusted prices
        val newItems = items.map {
            Product(it.id, it.name, it.basePrice * ratio, it.category)
        }
        
        // Clear and repopulate items
        items.clear()
        items.addAll(newItems)
    }
```

This mutable property allows getting and setting the total price of items in the cart. The setter recalculates the prices of all items to match the new total.

Let's add another extension property that calculates the final price after discounts.

```kotlin
val ShoppingCart.finalPrice: Double
    get() {
        if (this.customer == null) return this.totalPrice
        
        return this.items.sumOf { it.finalPriceFor(this.customer) }
    }
```

This property calculates the total price of all items after applying all applicable discounts for the customer.

#### 5. Creating extension properties with delegation

Kotlin's property delegation feature can be combined with extension properties for powerful results.

Let's create an extension property for the shopping cart that caches the computed final price using lazy delegation.

```kotlin
import kotlin.properties.ReadOnlyProperty
import kotlin.reflect.KProperty

class FinalPriceDelegate : ReadOnlyProperty<ShoppingCart, Double> {
    private var _value: Double? = null
    private var lastItemCount = -1
    
    override fun getValue(thisRef: ShoppingCart, property: KProperty<*>): Double {
        // Recalculate only if the number of items has changed
        if (_value == null || lastItemCount != thisRef.items.size) {
            lastItemCount = thisRef.items.size
            _value = thisRef.items.sumOf { product ->
                thisRef.customer?.let { product.finalPriceFor(it) } ?: product.basePrice
            }
        }
        return _value!!
    }
}

val ShoppingCart.cachedFinalPrice: Double by FinalPriceDelegate()
```

This property uses a custom delegate to compute the final price only when the number of items in the cart changes, caching the result for subsequent accesses.

#### 6. Creating generic extension properties

Let's create some generic extension properties that can work with collections of products.

First, I'll create a property that returns the most expensive product in a collection.

```kotlin
val Collection<Product>.mostExpensive: Product?
    get() = this.maxByOrNull { it.basePrice }
```

Now let's create a property that calculates the average price of products in a collection.

```kotlin
val Collection<Product>.averagePrice: Double
    get() = if (isEmpty()) 0.0 else sumOf { it.basePrice } / size
```

Let's add a property that returns all laptop products.

```kotlin
val Collection<Product>.laptops: List<Product>
    get() = this.filter { it.category == "Laptop" }
```

And a property that checks if the collection contains premium products (priced over $1000).

```kotlin
val Collection<Product>.hasPremiumProducts: Boolean
    get() = this.any { it.basePrice > 1000 }
```

#### 7. Demonstrating everything in the `main` function

Let's put everything together in a main function to see how it works.

```kotlin
fun main() {
```

First, let's create some users with different membership levels.

```kotlin
    // Creating users
    val basicUser = User(1, "Alex", "Basic", "2024-01-15")
    val standardUser = User(2, "Beth", "Standard", "2020-05-20")
    val premiumUser = User(3, "Charlie", "Premium", "2018-03-10")
```

Now let's create some laptop products.

```kotlin
    // Creating products
    val budgetLaptop = Product(101, "Budget Laptop", 650.0, "Laptop")
    val midRangeLaptop = Product(102, "Mid-Range Laptop", 1200.0, "Laptop")
    val premiumLaptop = Product(103, "Premium Laptop", 2500.0, "Laptop")
```

Let's use our extension properties to get information about the users.

```kotlin
    // Using user extension properties
    println("User Membership Info:")
    println("${basicUser.name} is a basic member: ${basicUser.isBasic}")
    println("${standardUser.name} is a standard member: ${standardUser.isStandard}")
    println("${premiumUser.name} is a premium member: ${premiumUser.isPremium}")
    println("${standardUser.name} has been a member for ${standardUser.membershipYears} years")
    println("${premiumUser.name} has been a member for ${premiumUser.membershipYears} years")
    println()
```

Now let's use our discount calculation properties.

```kotlin
    // Using discount extension properties
    println("Discount Information for ${midRangeLaptop.name} (${midRangeLaptop.basePrice}):")
    println("Basic discount: ${midRangeLaptop.basicDiscount}")
    println("Standard discount: ${midRangeLaptop.standardDiscount}")
    println("Premium discount: ${midRangeLaptop.premiumDiscount}")
    println()
```

Let's calculate the discounted prices for different users.

```kotlin
    // Using discounted price calculations
    println("Discounted Prices for ${premiumLaptop.name} (${premiumLaptop.basePrice}):")
    println("Price for ${basicUser.name}: ${premiumLaptop.discountedPriceFor(basicUser)}")
    println("Price for ${standardUser.name}: ${premiumLaptop.discountedPriceFor(standardUser)}")
    println("Price for ${premiumUser.name}: ${premiumLaptop.discountedPriceFor(premiumUser)}")
    println()
```

Let's use our promotion eligibility property.

```kotlin
    // Using validation properties
    val keyboard = Product(201, "Wireless Keyboard", 120.0, "Accessory")
    println("Promotion Eligibility:")
    println("${budgetLaptop.name} eligible for promotion: ${budgetLaptop.isEligibleForPromotion}")
    println("${premiumLaptop.name} eligible for promotion: ${premiumLaptop.isEligibleForPromotion}")
    println("${keyboard.name} eligible for promotion: ${keyboard.isEligibleForPromotion}")
    println()
```

Let's calculate loyalty discounts based on membership years.

```kotlin
    // Using loyalty discount calculations
    println("Loyalty Discounts:")
    println("${basicUser.name} (${basicUser.membershipYears} years) loyalty discount on ${midRangeLaptop.name}: ${midRangeLaptop.loyaltyDiscountFor(basicUser)}")
    println("${standardUser.name} (${standardUser.membershipYears} years) loyalty discount on ${midRangeLaptop.name}: ${midRangeLaptop.loyaltyDiscountFor(standardUser)}")
    println("${premiumUser.name} (${premiumUser.membershipYears} years) loyalty discount on ${midRangeLaptop.name}: ${midRangeLaptop.loyaltyDiscountFor(premiumUser)}")
    println()
```

Now let's create a shopping cart and use our cart extension properties.

```kotlin
    // Creating a shopping cart
    val cart = ShoppingCart()
    cart.items.add(budgetLaptop)
    cart.items.add(keyboard)
    
    // Using shopping cart extension properties
    println("Shopping Cart:")
    println("Total price: ${cart.totalPrice}")
    
    // Using our setter to adjust the total price
    cart.totalPrice = cart.totalPrice * 0.9  // Apply a 10% discount
    println("After 10% discount: ${cart.totalPrice}")
    
    println("Cached final price: ${cart.cachedFinalPrice}")
    println()
```

Finally, let's use our generic collection properties on a list of products.

```kotlin
    // Creating a product list
    val allProducts = listOf(budgetLaptop, midRangeLaptop, premiumLaptop, keyboard)
    
    // Using generic collection extension properties
    println("Product Collection Information:")
    println("Most expensive product: ${allProducts.mostExpensive?.name} at ${allProducts.mostExpensive?.basePrice}")
    println("Average price: ${allProducts.averagePrice}")
    println("Laptop products: ${allProducts.laptops.map { it.name }}")
    println("Collection has premium products: ${allProducts.hasPremiumProducts}")
}
```

When we run this code, we'll see how extension properties allow us to add new properties to existing classes like User, Product, and ShoppingCart, making our code more expressive and concise while encapsulating complex logic behind simple property access.

### Best practices and pitfalls

Let me share some tips from experience:

- **Keep extension properties focused:**
    - Like interfaces, extension properties should follow the Single Responsibility Principle. Each property should represent a single, well-defined concept. Avoid creating "super properties" that do too many things.
- **Extension properties can't have backing fields:**
    - Remember that extension properties don't actually modify the class they extend. They can't store state in the extended object, so they must compute their values in getters and setters. If you need to store state, consider other patterns like delegation or wrapper classes.
- **Be careful with nullability:**
    - When defining extension properties on nullable types (e.g., `String?`), make sure to handle the null case appropriately in your getters to avoid NullPointerExceptions.
- **Extension properties are resolved statically:**
    - Extension properties are resolved at compile time based on the declared type of the variable, not its runtime type. This can lead to surprises when working with polymorphic code.
- **Avoid side effects in getters:**
    - Property getters should generally be pure functions without side effects. Users expect that accessing a property doesn't change state or perform slow or unpredictable operations.
- **Use meaningful names:**
    - Choose names that clearly communicate what the property represents. A good extension property feels like it's a natural part of the original class.
- **Import extensions explicitly:**
    - Kotlin allows you to import specific extensions or all extensions from a package. Be explicit about which extensions you're importing to avoid name conflicts and make your code more maintainable.
- **Beware of conflicts:**
    - If an extension property has the same name as a member property in the class, the member property always wins. Be careful when naming your extension properties to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Consider performance:**
    - Extension properties that perform expensive computations can hurt performance if used frequently. Consider caching results or using lazy properties where appropriate.
- **Test your extensions:**
    - Just like any other code, extension properties should be thoroughly tested, especially if they encapsulate complex logic or validation rules.

### Conclusion

Extension properties are a powerful feature in Kotlin that enables you to enhance existing classes with new property-like behavior without modifying their source code. They embody Kotlin's philosophy of expressiveness, safety, and pragmatism, allowing you to write more concise and readable code by adapting existing APIs to your specific needs.

In our electronics store example, we've seen how extension properties can transform simple classes into rich, domain-specific objects with validation, conversion, and manipulation capabilities. We've also explored how extension properties can be combined with other Kotlin features like property delegation, nullability, and generics to create even more powerful abstractions.

As you continue working with Kotlin, you'll find extension properties indispensable for creating domain-specific languages, adapting existing libraries to your needs, and expressing concepts more naturally and concisely. Remember to keep them focused, name them meaningfully, and use them judiciously to create truly expressive and maintainable code.

Extension properties exemplify Kotlin's commitment to developer productivity and code quality. By allowing you to write code that reads like natural language while encapsulating complex logic, they help you create codebases that are not just functional but also a pleasure to work with.
